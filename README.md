# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project demonstrates how to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game where a player can play against the computer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game includes functionality for player moves, computer moves, game state management, and basic styles to make the game interactive and visually appealing.
